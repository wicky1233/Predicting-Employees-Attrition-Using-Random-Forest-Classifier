# Predicting Employees Attrition and Identify Factors Leading to Attrition

Employee attrition is a major challenge for organizations, as it affects their productivity and profitability. While there are various factors that contribute to attrition, organizations often struggle to identify the leading causes and take practical measures to retain their employees. Therefore, there is a need for a predictive model that can accurately predict employee attrition based on various factors such as job satisfaction, salary, work-life balance, etc. In addition, there is a need for exploratory data analysis to identify the leading causes of attrition and provide actionable insights to organizations. This project aims to address these needs by developing a machine-learning model that can predict employee attrition and identify its leading causes. The insights gained from this project can help organizations take proactive measures to retain their employees and maintain a healthy work environment.
